I will be using this file to keep track of the work that I am currently doing. Add notes here for what is done and what is pending and what are the
next reasonable steps and once I have everything working. I will then update the readMe as a readMe for others.

Till I reach that stage, this readMe is a readME only for ME :)

1. Set up a basic git repro
2. Download and install all the necessary packages required to set up a server
3. Write code just enough to run a server that listens on a particular port
4. Commit this code

5. Set up a connection to MongoDB and validate that you can connect to the same
6. Set up a basic route without any schema and make sure your first get request returns a hardcoded message
7. Commit
